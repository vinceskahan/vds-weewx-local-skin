Customed local skin for weewx
vinceskahan@gmail.com

This is the local skin I use as my default.

This expects to supersede weewx's Standard skin,
so read the installation instructions carefully.

It is also cross-linked into pages generated by my
'mem' and 'bootstrap' skins as corequisites.

Installation instructions:

1) run the installer:

setup.py install --extension vds-local.tgz

2) move the Standard skin out of HTML_ROOT in weewx.conf

edit weewx.conf and change the HTML_ROOT for [[StandardReport]]
  to point to public_html/Standard to move it to a subdirectory
  and/or comment the [[StandardReport]] block out to disable it

clean up any past weewx HTML_ROOT data, weewx will regenerate it
when it runs next

3) restart weewx:

sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop
sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start

This will result in a skin called vds-local that will write
into weewx HTML_ROOT to make it the default skin.

Note: this adds in a gauges.js file and RGraph tree for generating
  the gauges on the daily readings page, copying them into place
  via copy_once
