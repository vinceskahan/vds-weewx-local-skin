Customed local skin for weewx
vinceskahan@gmail.com

This is the local skin I use as my default.

This expects to supersede weewx's Standard skin,
so read the installation instructions carefully.

It is also cross-linked into pages generated by my
'mem' and 'bootstrap' skins as corequisites.

(important)
===========
Lastly, this installs a PiMonitor that grabs remote raspi
temperatures via a web query, and adds them to a local database
and to the local skin .tmpl files.

IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE PI ADDITIONS, DO NOT USE THIS CODE.
PLEASE USE THE CODE ON THE 'master' BRANCH.


Installation instructions:

1) run the installer:

setup.py install --extension vds-local.tgz

2) move the Standard skin out of HTML_ROOT in weewx.conf

edit weewx.conf and change the HTML_ROOT for [[StandardReport]]
  to point to public_html/Standard to move it to a subdirectory
  and/or comment the [[StandardReport]] block out to disable it

clean up any past weewx HTML_ROOT data, weewx will regenerate it
when it runs next

3) edit the remote_url in weewx.conf to point to where your Pi
   saves its temperature data

4) restart weewx:

sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop
sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start

This will result in a skin called vds-local that will write
into weewx HTML_ROOT to make it the default skin.

Note: this adds in a gauges.js file and RGraph tree for generating
  the gauges on the daily readings page, copying them into place
  via copy_once
